/********************************************************************************************

>	class PathProcessorStroke : public PathProcessor

	Author:		Jason_Williams (Xara Group Ltd) <camelotdev@xara.com>
	Created:	20/12/96

	Purpose:	This is the abstract base class for all PathProcessors.

				These classes are created by attributes (or similar) when rendered,
				and placed on a stack in the RenderRegion. Whenever RenderRegion::DrawPath
				is invoked to render a path, all stacked PathProcessors will be called in
				turn, and they call back to RenderRegion functions to render whatever they
				wish (usually a modified form of the original path).

				This can be used to "filter" almost any rendering, but is mainly intended
				for use by stroke and fill providers, which replace input paths with more
				suitable shapes to be rendered.

	SeeAlso:	RenderRegion::DrawPath; PathProcessor::ProcessPath
