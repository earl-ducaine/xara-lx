>	INT32 FuzzyClip(	PPOINT IPoints, PBYTE ITypes, UINT32 ILength, BOOL IsClosed,
					RECT *InnerRect, RECT *OuterRect, PPOINT pOPoints,
					PBYTE pOTypes, UINT32 pOMaxLength);

	Inputs:		IPoints,ITypes,ILength	- Source path
				IsClosed				- Source path and output path should be closed.
				InnerRect				- Inner rectangle to which to clip.
				OuterRect				- Outer rectangle to which to clip.
	Outputs:	pOPoints,pOTypes		- Outut path.
				pOMaxLength				- Maximum length of output path.
	Returns:	Returns the length of the path, or -1 if an error occurs.
				(ie output path not large enough).
	Purpose:	Note that InnerRect should be slightly larger than the window for which the
				clipping is being performed. This ensures that any slight errors won't be
				visible at the window edges.
				Note also that OuterRect must be over 3 times the width of InnerRect,
				with InnerRect centred within it.
				No errors should occur as the path is expected to be in a legal state.
