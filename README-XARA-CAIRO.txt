 This is XaraLX using the cairo graphics library to make the code completely open source.

Though the program is usable there are some things missing a.t.m. :
-no pathmath, so combining shapes, contour tool and bevel tool won't work.
-conical, three- and four point, fractal colorpattens/transparency patterns don't work
-probably some more things...

This jpg was made with xara-cairo :

(The .xar file is in the "examples" dir.)

It can export ( at least ) png and jpg atm.

xara-cairo will compile with wx-windows 2.8 ( which is configured with utf8 support ) on the linux platform.

In the future this program might get another name and might be developed further
if one or more interested c++ developers can be found. In the mean time i will
implement shadows, evt. pathmath and more missing stuff on the graphics side.
