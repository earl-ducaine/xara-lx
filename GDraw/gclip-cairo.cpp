	Comment from ...Kernel/Paths.cpp


'Flags' controls how Src will be clipped to this path (taken from gclip.h - complaints go to Gavin)
	CLIPPING_STYLE		- Clip style
	001					- 	  Source AND NOT Clip (subtract Clip from Source)
	010					-     Source AND     Clip (Intersection)
	011					-     Source
	100					- NOT Source AND     Clip (subtract Source from Clip)
	101					-     Source EOR	 Clip
	110					-	  				 Clip
	111					-     Source OR      Clip (Union)
		- If stroked then
	000					- Source AND     Clip (Intersection)
	???					- Source AND NOT Clip
	CLIPPING_SOURCE_WINDING - Source path winding.
	CLIPPING_CLIP_WINDING	- Clip path winding.
	CLIPPING_IS_STROKED		- Source is stroked, not filled
	CLIPPING_IS_CLOSED		- Source path is to be closed (only applicable if stroked).
