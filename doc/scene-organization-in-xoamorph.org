* high-level principals
  - Must have a natural hierarchy.
  - Must have a type system that's extensible and can be integrated
    with key words.
  - Type system should be mathematical as well.
  - object system must be integrated into type system
  - Dev environment must be integrated into type system.
  - Dev enviroment must be able to 'unroll' multiple inheritance most
    significant issue: determining the flow of control.
  - Must be easy to understand (intuitive)
  - Must be very easy to use
  - is alowed to be more difficult to set up a full system.
  - Must be amenable to iterative and dynamic
  - Must have reasonable performance.  Or at least theoretically
    possible to extract good performance from the system.
